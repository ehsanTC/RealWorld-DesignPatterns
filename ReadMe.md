# Real world usage of design patterns

This repo contains real world design patterns that I have developed. It goes beyond the simple examples in the tutorials and learning materials. For each pattern, I distinguished the degree of the difficulty of the code.

The patterns that added since now are:
 - [Observer](https://github.com/ehsanTC/RealWorld-DesignPatterns/tree/main/Observer)
 - [Strategy](https://github.com/ehsanTC/RealWorld-DesignPatterns/tree/main/Strategy)

Hope to be useful :blush:
