# Observer Pattern

The observer pattern is used when you want to send a message from an object to another that a task is done. 

In the observer example I crearted an observer that, when a graph node is met, a method in the observer is invoked.

Creating an interface is general in all OO languages like Java, C++ and others, but you can reach the same functionality by C# `Func<>` and `Action<>` delegates as well.
